LaserMaze is an exciting game that imitates the comically bad kind of laser security system found in heist movies. Using Arduino, augmented laser pointers, and a smoke machine, LaserMaze can transform any shipping container or hallway into a practice course for aspiring special agents.

It is currently still very much a prototype and the documentation of the project reflects this. For the most up to date documentation please see the [wiki](https://github.com/yurtman/LaserMaze/wiki).

##Features
- Made with easy to source components (laserpointers, basic electronics)
- Entrance/exit portal to start and stop the timer
- Auto calibration
- Steal detection (item to be stolen can be easily customised)
- Alarm sequence
- Open source

###Not yet implemented but being worked on:
- GUI to display high scores and alignment status (done in the processing language)
- scaling to the arduino Mega to include more lasers
- LED alarm lights integrated with the hardware and code
- sound effects and speaker (Alarm, Maze Active, enter the maze)
- expanding the current positioning strategies
- wireless communication and battery modules

###Abandoned goals:
- videofeed so attendant doens't need to stand inside the smoke filled container the whole day (IR light is also blocked by smoke... duh!)
- moving lasers (nice in the movies, very hard to actually make)

##Examples of use
The LaserMaze started as a hobby project with humble beginnings- a rats nest of alligator clips.

Since then development has not improved much but the experience resonates well with audiences of all ages and the prototype has already been used for quite a few events:
####Orbit Festival (21st Dec 2014)
